                This week consisted of more implementation of mechanics. Mainly the grapple mechanic. We also created a camera object to follow the player during this time. This was done rather easily by following a tutorial by Shaun Spaulding on YouTube. 
                The grapple mechanic is going to be the main idea of the game. All the level designs will be based off of it, hence we put extra emphasis when developing it. 
            </p>
            <h2>Development Process</h2>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>
                At first, we tried looking online for grappling hook tutorials. We found several but they were mostly unsatisfactory because they did not account for a lot of things. The tutorials weren't complete and most of them were horribly unoptimised, so we decided to develop our own. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We assigned Cheng En to be the main developer of the grappling hook. He spent the better part of the week focusing mainly on the hook. A rough idea of how the hook worked was created by him. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The rough idea Cheng En had was adding pure x coordinates and y coordinates to the player as movement in the general direction of the hook. This resulted in many problems in terms of the optimisation. The x and y coordinate movement made the hook seem very robotic, and there were no exact way to calculate the angle at which to pull the player towards. The hook also had no vaulting effect afterwards because its pure x and y coordinates. There were no acceleration/deceleration involved, hence it was impossible to get a small jump effect after the hook to make it seem more natural.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus, by the end of the week, we were running out of ideas on how to improve the hook without redoing the entire mechanic. After this disappointing week of development, we put off the grappling hook for awhile to work on other things to rebuild our team morale. 
            </p>
            <h2>Bug fixing challenges</h2>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>
                One of the problems we encountered that we did not manage to solve was the collision checks. The grapple was pulling the player into the wall after grappling. This was one of the reasons why we were so demoralized by the grapple. We still have not figured out how to solve it yet. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The camera had no issues though, it was smooth sailing as the tutorial was clear and precise on what to do. Praise Shaun Spaulding honestly, what a great guy. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I had the idea of making the camera move based on mouse position, I implemented that into the camera object but removed it after a day or two because it felt too nauseatic to play with the constant aiming to shoot or grapple. 
            </p>
            <h2>New Ideas</h2>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>
                We had another discussion about what we can do to further improve the playability of the game, and came up with several ideas as previously discussed in Week 1
                <ul>
                    <li>Bullet Hell boss fights (CupHead inspiration)</li>
                    <li>Spikes</li>
                    <li>Keys and Locks</li>
                    <li>Chests</li>
                </ul>
                At this point we realised maybe we bit off more than we could chew, but being the ambitious smartass I am I said that we should do them all or die trying. 
                
            </p>
            <h2>Expectations</h2>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>
                Thus ended this week. The game is progressing quite well. I think we'd have time to do more levels because the mechanics are fairly simple, other than the grapple of course.
