                Week 1 was not very productive development wise, since we were all new to GameMaker 1.4 and had 
                no idea what our game was going to be about. 
                We spent the better part of the week watching tutorials and learning the basics of GameMaker 1.4. Surprisingly, 
                the programming part was easy to grasp and I picked it up quite easily. There were tons of tutorials
                online for us to follow and learn so that helped immensely as well. 
            </p>
            <h2>Idea</h2>
            <p>
                The idea was honestly a wild one. I've always been a huge fan of games that have interesting travel mechanics like Spiderman, Prototype
                and Just Cause 3. They make travelling around in-game so much more satisfying through usage of grappling hooks and gliders. The travel mechanics 
                can also be used in combat, so it felt really natural to be playing the game itself. That was where the idea stemmed from. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The game idea is a treasure hunter, looking for treasures underneath. In a pyramid tomb-raiding setting (you can see where we got the story from), 
                players have to fight through creatures of the dark and find treasure chests with nothing but a gun and a grapple. It's meant to be a platformer 
                with intense boss fights through the usage of the grapple. We developed this idea over the week and by now I consider it quite polished.
            </p>
            <p>
                I based the game off several platformers that are considered good such as Celeste and Super Meat Boy. Going into this game,
                I knew it was going to be hard to code the physics part of the grapple, but either way we were optimistic and ambitious enough
                to start working on it after a few days of learning (and procrastination).
            </p>
            <h2>Game Mechanics</h2>
            <p>
                For this week, we focused mainly on the movement mechanics we want to put into the game. We created a list of mechanics that were plausible and added most of 
                them into the game: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Grappling hook ★</li>
                    <li>Acceleration</li>
                    <li>Jump (of course)</li>
                    <li>Double jump</li>
                    <li>Jump height variable</li>
                    <li>Wall jump</li>
                </ul>
                These were the movement mechanics that we planned to add into the game. By the end of this week, I managed to add the jump, acceleration, jump height variable
                and double jump mechanics. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course we also discussed other mechanics like Traps, Bullet Hell and more platformer based mechanics. But we wanted to get the game playable as soon as
                possible so we did not really go in depth into it. But the basic idea of the game being bullet hell-ish for boss fights and platformer based for exploration
                was pretty much set. 
            </p>
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>
                The challenge this week was the collision. I did not know that code placements affected collisions. I did collision check at the start of my code and spent about
                a day with my group figuring out why the player drops through the floor. It was frustrating to bugfix because the code was not at fault. It was the logic. I realised at the end
                of this week that GameMaker's programming is not really hard to grasp, but the logic has to be impeccable for the game to run smoothly. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Bugfixing is of course another challenge. The double jump mechanic was quite hard to implement as there was a ground check and a jump limit of 2 times to ensure that players 
                don't go flying all over the place. It took me quite awhile to get it right even with tutorials on YouTube. But as always the satisfaction of seeing the mechanic work 
                beautifully is quite the reward for bugfixing it.
            </p>
            <h2>Sprites</h2>
            <p>
                For the sprites, we just wanted something simple and easy to bugfix. So we used a stickman and white walls as a base. The good thing about sprites is that any changes made
                to it will not affect the code, so we can just change it later on when we're sure that the game runs smoothly. I think this was a good strategy because bugfixing good looking
                sprites has to be more infuriating because you'd expect them to work. That's just my opinion though.
