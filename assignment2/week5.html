                This is the week of grinding. We still had the boss level, mechanics, sound effects and basically polishing for all mechanics to finish up. Cheng En added a flamethrower that was supposed to spin, but because of the GitHub crash on the day of submission, it got corrupted and now Ernest and Cheng En's level got a little harder. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Sound effects were found and implemented by Ernest. I mainly focused on the levels and other little details like connecting the rooms together and where to add checkpoints. 
            </p>
            <h2>Boss Room</h2>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>
                The boss room consists of 2 rooms. For phase 1 and 2 of the boss. When the boss reaches 50% hp, the player and the boss is transported to the 2nd room. The first room has a platform for the player to walk and dodge the boss's attacks, the 2nd room only has grapple but with reduced gravity to lower the difficulty a little bit as we realised it was too hard to kill the boss with the base gravity. 
            </p>
            <h2>Boss Mechanics</h2>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>
                The boss is basically bullet hell based. There is 2 sequences that it randomly switches between in phase 1, and one more in phase 2. The boss also teleports around the map to surprise the player. Cheng En is responsible for the boss mechanics itself as well as the boss room. 
            </p>
            <h2>Flamethrower</h2>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>
                This trap was supposed to add more challenges to the grappling hook but the spinning effect did not work after the GitHub merging issue I had in the morning on the day of submission. It was a shame because the mechanic is so well put together by Cheng En but because of my incompetence it is not at it's full potential. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The spin adds more difficulty because the player has to time their grapple at the right time to pass through without getting burned. There is also the basic option to just spit fire as it is. 
            </p>
            <h2>Sound Effects</h2>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>
                Ernest found the perfect background music online. We used the same background music from Cave Story, a popular platformer, for our game. Personally, I think it fit the theme quite well. The sound effects for the gun was also satisfying. Overall I think our sounds complements the gameplay well. 
            </p>
            <h2>Polishing</h2>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>
                The polishing of game mechanics and ensuring that everything works as intended was by me. I ensured that all the rooms were connected, the levels were at the very least able to be completed and so on. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I struggled with the time pressure though because the polishing only took place after everything was completed, which was near the submission deadline. On top of that I merged the files incorrectly and lost a few of the important code and did not manage to add them back in time. That led to the flamethrower not working and the signposts feeling very out of place from the game.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>
                Working under time constraint, I realised that proper versioning is extremely important when it comes to game development because a single line of code that goes missing can reduce the functionality of the game significantly. It has been such a disappointing climax to the amazing development of this game. I had so much fun implementing mechanics, bugfixing and level designing but the loss of data had almost ruined our game. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There was no one to blame but myself. My complacency reduced the quality of our final product.
            </p>
            <p>
                Coming to the end of this assignment, I learnt the importance of good communication and proper backup of files. The reason why we managed to submit on time was because Cheng En had a backup (thankfully), and we were able to churn out the game in time for submission. From the huge mistake I made near the end of the assignment, I hope I can learn from it and never repeat it again.
            </p>
            <p>
                All in all, this assignment has taught me more about not only game development, but also working in a group in general. Without my teammates, I would not be able to complete a game of this scale myself. The teamwork we had throughout the game's development was more than what I could ask for and I am proud of the final product regardless.

            <h2>Individual Contributions</h2>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>
                I was mainly responsible for the movement mechanics, basic mechanics, level design and polishing of the game. Here is the list of things I did:
                <ul>
                    <li>Acceleration</li>
                    <li>Jump</li>
                    <li>Wall jump</li>
                    <li>Grapple (Polishing up)</li>
                    <li>Level 1_1 - 1_4</li>
                    <li>Dart Trap (Polishing up)</li>
                    <li>Teleporting mechanic (Warp)</li>
                    <li>Checkpoints</li>
                    <li>Double Jump (removed)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                My other team members' contributions can be found on their designer diary. We did quite a lot of the things together, like level design and stuff. We helped each other out essentially when one of us got stuck. We filled in the gaps of one another's weaknesses. I'm bad with art, so Ernest and Cheng En covered for me. We give each other ideas and such, and give comments on each other's work. It's a good team dynamic.
