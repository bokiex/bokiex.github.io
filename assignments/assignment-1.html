    <h1>Assignment 1: Board Game Prototype - Designer Diary</h1>
    <div class="desc">
        <p>
            This assignment required us to come up with a board game prototype
            after allowing us to test out the different types of board game
            mechanics present through playing many types of board games in 
            class
        </p>
        <p>
            We have to pen down our design ideas and train of thought throughout
            the design process. The different concepts we had before and 
            what we included/excluded.

            <h2>The Million Dollar Idea</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>
                I joined the group a little late for this assignment as I 
                thought I had a group. They were already discussing the idea
                and had a general sense of what the game was going to be like 
                when I joined. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The game is a board/card game. It's like a card game dungeon crawler 
                with linear progression in levels. It is based off of the many 
                card games online and we got a few card designs and ideas from 
                the different card games as well. The basis of it is that you build
                your deck along as you go through the levels, creating synergies and
                getting better cards to fight stronger monsters.

            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>
                We took it to Discord to discuss about the design. We wanted 
                the essence of a card game to stay while implementing board 
                game mechanics. Together with a hint of randomness in everything
                to spice it up a little. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We decided that the level design should have a linear progression 
                with a boss fight at the end. Just a regular dungeon gameplay 
                to reach the top and defeat the final boss.
            </p>
            <p>
                This simple level design allowed us to focus on card mechanics 
                and design. We put in a lot more thought into the card design
                in terms of synergy between cards and the different element themes
                that you can follow to build a deck.

            <h2>Difficulties</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>
                One of the first issues we had was balancing the game. Of course that 
                goes for all games, but I was pretty inexperienced in balancing card games
                so it was quite a tough thing for me to pick up. We countered this by
                dictating how much 1 mana is worth. Then, we add more attributes based
                on the element of the card. For example, Fire cards have more damage,
                Water cards have more healing and Earth cards have more block. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The second bigger issue was the Random Number Generator (RNG) aspect of the game.
                After playtesting our first prototype, we've come to realise that our game
                didn't promote much strategising and didn't encourage smart plays. 
                A lot of the game is based on luck, which made it a little unfun for players
                trying to win. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The third one is gameplay itself. Our game focuses on deckbuilding, and Mr Oon 
                raised a good question on whether there is a winning deck. A deck that no matter 
                what, will always result in a win. We realised there might be some issues with 
                overpowered decks and combos that grants basically immortality. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, the deckbuilding aspect of the game was kind of lacklustre in the sense
                that there wasn't much opportunities to gain and discard cards. That resulted in the 
                huge variety of cards to be untapped throughout the entire game and the starting cards
                playing a bigger impact on the game rather than the other cards. Combos and synergies 
                were also harder to get and set up as there were very little cards to work with, so 
                unless you're lucky, there's no chance of getting the cards you need for a good
                combo.
