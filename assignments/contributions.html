                Honestly I think everyone in the group had their fair share of ideas and designs 
                that were put into the final game. The manual labor of pasting cards were done by
                all of us. Art was mostly Steve though because he has the experience. I’m proud 
                of the game we came up with regardless.
            </p>
            <h2>Card Design</h2>
            <p>
                All of us sat down for about 3 hours straight to discuss the different card elements
                and themes that we were going to have for each element. It was draining but I think
                all of us contributed a lot for the ideation process of the cards.
            </p>
            <p>
                I managed to come up with about 15-20 card designs, I’m not sure. But Steven helped me
                fool-proof it by checking whether the card fits the theme. We had to remove several of
                my ideas at the start because they were too out of place. 
            </p>
            <h2>Game Mechanics</h2>
            <p>
                We all collectively came up with many of the game mechanics. I’m especially proud of 
                the one-two encounter mapping. It was what we needed to make it into more of a strategic game.
            </p>
            <p>
                Treasures were a nice touch as well, together with the shop mechanic. Many of the ideas
                we got inspiration from other games and just added our own touch to it. 
            </p>
            <h2>General Ideas</h2>
            <p>
                When making the game, certain ideas will occasionally pop up in my mind, same goes for everyone 
                else. We shared our ideas with one another and discussed to reach a compromise. It was really 
                cool seeing how our ideas blend together and get fleshed out over the discussion.
            </p>
            <h2>Creating the Board and Filming</h2>
            <p>
                All of us came up with the general idea and agreed upon it and Steve beautified it. I took several 
                of the scenes in the video pitch and gave my thoughts during video editing. We did the video about 2
                days before the submission so I'm happy with how it turned out. We had to add a whole other video
                explaining the rules to the original one because we found out that the pitch had to include explanation
                of how to play the game.
