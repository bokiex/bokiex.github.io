                    <p>
                        For the setup of the game, we needed to be able to track player’s Health,
                        Armour, Gold, enemy’s Health and Armour, the Encounter card placeholders to
                        track where the player currently is and the Level and Stage the player is on.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Initially, we planned to create a circular disc for tracking mana, because the
                        original intent of mana was to dice roll it. However, after a bit of logical
                        thinking and debate, we came to realise that dice rolling mana was too
                        inconsistent to provide a strategic gameplay.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thus we just chose to start with
                        3 mana every turn, discarding the disc completely and making it more of a deckbuilding
                        and synergy based game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We had a rough draft at the start of the game:
                        <ul class="list">
                            <li>
                                Created the basis of the Encounter map where it alternates between
                                Encounter cards that you have to resolve and choosing between two Encounter cards to resolve
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A way to track monster and player stats. We had to put a cap on the health else
                                we would not have space for the numbers, so it was really a rough sketch. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A simple level design with 3 Levels for play testing, which ended up being our main
                                prototype. We wanted to have 7 Levels in total and an extra ‘Insane’ difficulty that
                                required you to start from Level 2 but after realising how long the average play-time took, 
                                we ditched the idea.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We decided that the level design should have a linear progression with a boss fight at the end.
                        Just a regular dungeon gameplay to reach the top and defeat the final boss.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This simple level design allowed us to focus on card mechanics and design. We put in a lot
                        more thought into the card design in terms of synergy between cards and the different element
                        themes that you can follow to build a deck.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That was the main idea, after a few improvements we wound up with the final product which
                        was 4 A4 sized paper for Level, Player stats, Monster stats and Encounters.

                        This is the heart of the game, it’s where all of our creativity and resources went.
                        Each card that we came up with was balanced and checked whether it fit the theme of the 
                        element as well as how it will play into the game. It’s not the best balancing system, 
                        but I think we’ve put in a fair amount of effort in balancing it.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Deck-Building</h3>
                    <p>
                        We came up with a total ratio of deckbuilding cards to have which was:
                        <ul class="list">
                            <li>
                                5 Offense : 3 Defense : 2 Passive
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then from there, each element had their own ratio to fit the theme of the element. 
                        Fire had more offense, Water and Earth had more defense and Arcana had more passive, 
                        to balance this, the other stats were reduced. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In doing so, we hoped to encourage building on one or two elements at most when
                        choosing your cards. Fire spells dealt about +3 the regular mana to damage conversion rate,
                        Water has healing abilities, Earth has blocks and Arcana has passives that synergises well 
                        with its cards. Through building on the same element, players can bring out the best traits 
                        of the element and synergise the cards with one another.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                E.g: Pheonix Feather: Fire spells to do 2 more damage when combo-ed with Napalm:
                                Deal 1 damage 4 times, deals a whopping 12 damage. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The flavour text was also a fun part of designing these cards. Being able to come 
                        up with quirky sentences to describe the cards made the process more endurable and less 
                        boring. I do think we took it a tad too far though, but I’m still happy about it. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We tried to make all of the deckbuilding cards unique from one another, each card has 
                        its own purpose and synergy, some bad cards that are only good when paired with a synergy card.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Water Retention: Deal damage equal to total Health healed this turn is a pretty useless 
                                card on its own. But when paired with Healing Bath and Surf, both of which heals 3, it
                                can deal a total of 12 damage. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Same goes for Rock Smash: Deal damage based on amount of block this turn
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We wanted to put in draw cards at first, having Arcana being the draw element, but we had 
                        a problem of having too big of a deck, there were no options to discard the bad cards. When 
                        we added the discard option, overpowered synergies became really easy to get. Sticking with 
                        4 cards that constantly deals a ton of damage and heals made the game really easy. Thus we 
                        removed the draw option from the spell cards and added a draw mechanic that draws from 
                        the deck the player has already built rather than gaining a new card.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The ideation process for these cards are mostly just inspiration from other card games for
                        me. Elemental spells came from the different shows I’ve watched and games I’ve played. Most 
                        of them are basic card ideas as we did not want to introduce too many elements to keep the 
                        game easy to learn. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Treasure</h3>
                    <p>
                        This was a reward system created for players to gain permanent passives that will aid in 
                        scaling into the later levels. We wanted to make it rewarding to choose for a treasure when
                        it shows up in the Encounter map, so we thought of making them permanent for the rest of the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are also one time use treasures that can help you scale better into late game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Initially we wanted to make the treasures all one time, but we realised that was too 
                        lacklustre in the long run so we changed most of them to passives.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Monster</h3>
                    <p>
                        At the start, we made the monsters really weak and dealt really little damage because we
                        wanted it to scale into late game, but we quickly realised that the scale was also weaker than 
                        expected, and fighting the monsters didn’t really amount to much of a challenge. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the second iteration of monsters, we increased the health and damage significantly, 
                        taking into account the heal and block players can get from spells. The scaling system was to
                        make it multiply by the Level the player is currently on. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We tried not to base the health off of dice roll too much, but just nice enough so that
                        getting a high roll does not end the game for you and getting a low roll still provides a bit of a challenge.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Trap</h3>
                    <p>
                        The trap encounters are there as a warning for players. This motivates them to keep themselves healthy '
                        and punishes bad decisions. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We decided to add traps into the game as a way to spice it up. Rather than having just monsters and
                        rewards, we wanted a way to punish the players for not considering the possibilities of traps. Keep 
                        them on the edge and introduce another excitement factor.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Shop</h3>
                    <p>
                        The shop is where players get to spend their gold. They can choose whether to spend it on discarding 
                        cards or adding more cards into their deck or adding a treasure to your deck.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Initially we wanted to make the shop a permanent thing where you can spend your gold anytime but
                        we figured having it made into an encounter would make more sense story wise because a shop following
                        you around seems absurd.
                    </p>
                    <p>Question Mark</p>
                    <p>
                        These encounters are for players to choose A or B. Most of them are either to interact with 
                        the item or leave it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Provides reward or punishment for interacting with it based on dice roll. It’s a way for players to
                        get a headstart in the game if they are willing to risk health, gold or treasures for it.
