            <hr />
            <p>
                We took it to Discord to discuss about the design. We wanted
                the essence of a card game to stay while implementing board
                game mechanics. Together with a hint of randomness in everything
                to spice it up a little.
            </p>
            <p>
                We decided that the level design should have a linear progression
                with a boss fight at the end. Just a regular dungeon gameplay
                to reach the top and defeat the final boss.
            </p>
            <p>
                This simple level design allowed us to focus on card mechanics
                and design. We put in a lot more thought into the card design
                in terms of synergy between cards and the different element themes
                that you can follow to build a deck.
