            <h2>Balancing the game</h2>
            <p>
                One of the first issues we had was balancing the game. Of course that goes 
                for all games, but I was pretty inexperienced in balancing card games so it 
                was quite a tough thing for me to pick up.
            </p>
            <p>
                We countered this by dictating how much 1 mana is worth. Then, we add more 
                attributes based on the element of the card.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, Fire cards have more damage, Water cards have more healing and
                Earth cards have more block. 
            </p>
            <h2>Random Number Generator (RNG)</h2>
            <p>
                RNG has always been a factor in card games. Good card games have balance 
                between RNG and strategic gameplay. When balanced, they go hand in hand together
                to make a fun and strategic game. An example would be Hearthstone. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Our game was a card game after all, so we had some RNG in it to make it more
                interactive. However, the first prototype of the game we made for playtesting had
                way too many RNG factors in it. Almost all actions had some form of RNG in it. The 
                player’s draw, the spell’s damage, the monster’s health, the monster’s damage and 
                the question mark encounter cards. This made the game stale and boring in the sense
                that thinking was not encouraged and rolling a high roll was one if not the only way to win.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the playtest, we sat down and discussed. From there we decided to reduce many of
                the RNG factors and calculations that included dice rolls were adapted to reduce the range
                of numbers the monster’s health can be, allowing us to better predict and scale the monster. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We still kept the rolling to resolve Question Mark encounters as it was a fun option to
                have but we changed the deckbuilding to having a constant pool of 3 cards to choose from that
                the player can either choose one from it, take a random from the deck and refresh the 3 or 
                just refresh the 3. It added a little bit of strategic deckbuilding into the game that I 
                think was much needed.
            </p>
            <h2>Deck-Building</h2>
            <p>
                Lastly, the deckbuilding aspect of the game was kind of lacklustre during the playtest in
                the sense that there wasn't much opportunities to gain and discard cards. That resulted in
                the huge variety of cards to be untapped throughout the entire game and the starting cards
                playing a bigger impact on the game rather than the other cards.
            </p>
            <p>
                Combos and synergies were also harder to get and set up as there were very little cards to
                work with, so unless the player is lucky, there's no chance of getting the cards players
                need for a good combo.
            </p>
            <p>
                To solve this issue, we decided to allow players to draw a card after every encounter, 
                but we soon realised that led to too many cards in hand, so we had to come up with ways to 
                discard cards. We added the option to either discard a card or draw a card after every encounter.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, we noticed that it made deckbuilding too easy. Players can get overpowered synergy cards
                and just discard the useless ones in order to keep drawing the same synergy cards. It broke the
                game. Thus we changed it to allowing draws only when players defeat a monster and after every trap.
            </p>
            <h2>Starter Decks</h2>
            <p>
                Originally, the intent of starter decks was to have it elementless (Arcana). We wanted it to
                be basic and encourage players to build cards of other elements together with Arcana cards. 
                But I think the starting deck came out as a little too overpowered.
            </p>
            <p>
                I suggested an idea of having different elemental starter decks but we were too short of time 
                to make it, so we just stuck with the overpowered starter deck. This had a few problems in itself
                as players would be breezing through stages in Level 1.
            </p>
            <p>
                Arcana cards also had more value because they can synergise with the starter deck of 8 cards, 
                which is pretty broken when paired together with Arcane Coupon: Reduce all Arcana spells by 1 cost. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This was one of the difficulties we did not manage to come around to. I think we should’ve had 
                different elemental starter decks but it’s hard to come up with card designs on the go and under 
                stress of all the other assignments, it was practically impossible for us to make a deck for each 
                of the elements. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The starter deck was also supposed to be slightly underpowered to compensate for the early 
                monster’s scaling, but we did not get around to that as well.
