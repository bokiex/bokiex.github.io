            <h2>The Million Dollar Idea</h2>
            <p>
                I joined the group a little late for this assignment as I
                thought I had a group. They were already discussing the idea
                and had a general sense of what the game was going to be like
                when I joined. Their idea was based around Deck-Building, Dungeon
                delving, single-player board and card game. 
            </p>
            <p>
                They intitially had ideas for a Monopoly type game where players roll
                the dice and move. Another idea was a chess type game where the pieces
                fighting each other are monsters versus students. In the end they settled 
                on this game because of all of their experience prior in playing card games
                as well as Steve's general interest in the Deck-Building category.
            </p>
            <p>
                The basis of the game is a dungeon crawler where the player will play as an
                apprentice sourcerer (note the misspelling, it's intentional) fighting 
                through halls crawling with monsters in their school in order to get to the 
                top floor and defeat the summoner to stop the monsters from swarming the 
                school.
