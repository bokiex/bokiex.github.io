            We will be exploring the different types of game mechanics in this workshop. 
            Game mechanics are guidelines designed for interaction between the game and the player, 
            providing gameplay.

            <h2>Two game mechanics that I enjoy: Race and Jumping</h2>
            <hr />
            <h3>Race</h3>
            <p>
                Racing games have always been on my top 10 list of games to play. The exhilaration 
                I get from beating someone, and the increasingly daunting fact that anyone can take
                over me as I'm reaching the finish line makes me a fan of the Race mechanic. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A classic racing game would be the Mario Kart series. That game has probably ruined 
                a few friendships because of the infamous Blue Shell. Seeing it take away all hopes and
                completely crush the first place's dreams as he or she closes in on the finish line is
                the most satisfying thing. But when it happens to me I wish hell upon the person who
                threw that cursed shell. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Another game is from the arcade. The Midnight Maximum Tune series. I've spent quite a fortune
                on that game just trying to progress in the story to upgrade my car just to get completely 
                annihilated by some rich kid. There was a fond memory of me destroying 3 players of higher calibre than me
                because they didn't notice me closing in while they were clashing trying to fight for first place. 
                The satisfying drift on the last turn as I pass the 3 of them at one go and hit the finish line 
                still gives me goosebumps till today.
            </p>
            <h3>Jumping</h3>
            <p>
                The jumping mechanic is most frequently found in platformers. I'm particularly fond of this mechanic
                because of it's simplicity, it's just a hop off the ground, albeit gravity-defying. It has led to countless
                possibilities in game and level design, creating many masterpieces that are still prevalent today. 
                In the speedrunning community especially, people exploit jumps in a way that is almost methodical to watch.
                It's as though they took the level and made another game from it. Magical is the way to describe good speedrunners
                when they perform impossible jumps to skip a part of the game to get a better time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Games like Mario, Hollow Knight, Cuphead, Nier:Automata, Brawlhalla and, hell, even Mario Kart all have 
                my beloved jumping mechanic in it. Platformer games like Super Mario 64 pushed the boundaries of this simple mechanic,
                including side-flips, front flips, back flips and wall-jumps into the game. It created so many different ways to 
                complete a level.

            <h2>Two game mechanics that I don't enjoy: Building and Hidden Image</h2>
            <hr />
            <h3>Building</h3>
            <p>
                Building games don't spark my interest because the number of hours it takes to complete a build is often more 
                than a single digit. On top of that, I don't have much of a creativity mind when it comes to building things
                because I don't know where to start. I'd much prefer a step by step guide on how to build things but that would
                take up even more of my time trying to follow it. The end product is satisfying, sure, but the process of building 
                is dull. Gathering materials, crafting the blocks, placing it and then repeating the process all over is hard for me
                to enjoy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Minecraft and Cities Skyline are the two games that I've tried and tried again to enjoy but just couldn't after a few hours. 
            </p>
            <h3>Hidden Image</h3>
            <p>
                This genre just doesn't appeal to me in any way. There's no action, only storyline progression. Getting stuck on a level because
                you missed a small piece of paper stuck behind a bookshelf you have to move isn't fun to me 
            </p>
            <p>
                Many spot the difference games have this. Also point and click adventures as stated in the website.

            <h2>Tron Legacy: Remake</h2>
            <hr />
            <h3>Game mechanics: Spinning Plates, Race and Block Path</h3>
            <h3>Map:</h3>
            <p>
                Multiple lanes leading to the finish line will be the race track.
                They will criss cross and players can switch lanes during the intersections.
            </p>
            <h3>Mechanic:</h3>
            <p>
                Players will have a fuel bar and an energy bar. The fuel bar is used when the vehicle accelerates and
                the energy bar is used when the player wishes to create a trail behind him. The trail kills any player that it
                comes into contact with, like in Tron. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Fuel recharge is found throughout the track, like Mario Kart power ups. Energy bar can only be recharged if
                you ride close to the trail of an enemy or if you collide with them.
