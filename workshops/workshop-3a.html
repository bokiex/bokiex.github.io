                In this workshop, we explore the different genres that games come in. Through the videos, I've learnt that
                different genres of video games appeal to different demographics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Game genres help people find similar games which they enjoy, and help game developers create games that
                can better target specific demographics.

            <h2>2 genres that I enjoy: Action and Adventure/RPG</h2>
            <hr />
            <h3>Action</h3>
            <p>
                Most people enjoy action games because they are usually full of competitiveness and excitement. These are games
                that push your reflexes to the limits and gives an amazing sense of accomplishment when you win or do well. 
                Action games stand out because of how challenging they are at times. They create obstacles for players playing the game, and reward the players accordingly either through a
                huge loot bonus or ranking them up. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Personally, I enjoy these games because the competitiveness never gets boring and the feeling I get beating a boss
                after countless tries is something I chase after time and again. Rhythm games like Osu!, Deemo and Cytus gives me the 
                same chill down my spine as if I've defeated a boss when I finally get an 'S' rank on the song I've been grinding. 
            </p>
            <h3>Adventure/RPG</h3>
            <p>
                Successful Adventure and Role-Playing Games are usually content heavy in terms of monsters, quests and items. They give users something to work towards, for example,
                killing Ganon in Legend of Zelda: BOTW. They then set up obstacles and puzzles along the way that rewards you with items that will aid you in your quest to defeat Ganon.
                This example is most frequently seen in single player RPG. Massive Multiplayer Online RPG (MMORPG) is a whole nother beast. They provide end-game bosses that gives
                amazing loot and experience so that players will grind till they are able to slay them. MMORPGs are games like World of Warcraft, MapleStory and Dragon Nest allow 
                you the freedom to create characters of different classes to grind to max level in order to fight end-game bosses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another side of RPG is story-based RPG. Games like Hollow Knight, Nier: Automata, Assassin's Creed series and The Witcher 3 are all story-driven games. They bring you around in 
                a beautiful sandbox world crafted by the developers telling their stories. Plough through the game by doing main quests, with side quests from NPCs around you to add in another layer
                of immersiveness and unlock new places to explore or new weapon upgrades that will help you to progress through the game. These games went from simple story RPGs to full fledged storyline
                with character development. Seeing your character evolve from a complete utter noob to an unstoppable killing machine is but one of the many reasons why people play story-based RPGs.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy these games because getting the item that you have worked so hard for is really rewarding. I remember fondly spending hours grinding for coins during an event
                in MapleStory just to get a ring that gives good stats. Even though it was minimal in my progress to fight against the end-game bosses, it's still an achievement nonetheless.
                That's the beauty of these games honestly, every little progress you make adds up and eventually, before you know it, you will be killing bosses like regular mobs. 
                Story-based RPG is much more focused on character development. There are still hack and slashes but now there are motives behind it. Maybe the person you are hacking and slashing 
                has done you great wrong in the storyline, or maybe someone just wanted him dead. Who knows. It's for the player to play it out. It feels as though I'm an active audience
                in a masterful play whenever I play story-based RPG where I get to choose how I want it to go about.

            <h2>A genre that I don't enjoy: Strategy</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>
                These games require intense planning before executing a move or building an entire city. It is often time-consuming and tedious to pull off, but when someone manages to do it well, 
                the results never fail to amaze others. Take for example, Cities Skyline. I can hardly build a small city without creating a major traffic jam in some intersections. Some people 
                are able to create Metropolises and Skyscrapers housing millions of citizens in one city without any traffic congestions. Through careful planning and execution, they create 
                intersections that mimic real life to the point where research has to actually be done in order to build it. How amazing is that?
            </p>
            <p>
                Some strategy games even teaches you real world knowledge just by you playing it. Kerbal Space Program is a good example. Build a rocket that goes to space, sounds easy right? But now your astronaut
                is lacking oxygen. Oh no the tank is too heavy. What boosters to use to maximise takeoff efficiency? Is there a way to land it? The rocket parts they use, the science and mathematics behind
                the thrust and power that each booster provides creates this simulator of real life rocket take-off, to the point where it is used to test actual rockets! It's a bit off track here but 
                the strategy here is knowing when to use what, and how to make things more efficient. I consider that strategy because the point of strategising is to limit losses and increase profits. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't dislike these games honestly, I just don't have the mental capacity to play them. They take up so much time and effort, and often have subpar rewards like watching cars flow
                through the traffic (honestly how do people grind these games?). I do like to watch people build things though. Sped up process of building real life structures in Minecraft and 
                creating a Metropolis from scratch. These videos are therapeutic and I enjoy them. It doesn't mean I want to actually do it though because I know I'll give up about an hour in 
                when I miscalculate something by a block and have to destroy pretty much my entire structure for it.
