            Kongregate is an American mobile, PC, and Console publisher and web gaming portal. The website features over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kongregate">110,000</a>
            online games. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The workshop required us to pick and choose any 2 games from Kongregate and play for 15 minutes per game.
            The two games I chose were Infectonator 2 and Shopping Cart Hero.

            <h2>Game 1: <a href="https://www.kongregate.com/games/TogeProductions/infectonator-2">Infectonator 2</a></h2>
            <hr />
            <p>
                I chose Infectonator 2 as Infectonator was somewhat a childhood game of mine. I've always wanted to infect everyone and everything, amassing a huge army of zombies.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game is about, as the name suggests, infecting people. You get several abilities and zombies that you can spawn and use to your advantage as you try your best to 
                infect everyone in a selected part of the world. There is a lot of pixelated gore and blood as the zombies chase down the civilians. It is a simple concept of a game 
                so the storyline was just the standard zombie apocalyptic setting. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I played as a perpetrator in infecting people. At the start, I drop viruses that turns people into zombies, then I can choose to spawn different zombie types to infect more 
                civilians as I go along. With the use of grenades and bomb canisters to rid the place of police and the army. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, I think the game is quite fun considering how simplistic it is. The feeling you get when the zombies overrun the city is honestly the main motivator for me.
                However, there are certain times when you have to grind for upgrades to make your zombies stronger and more resilient to attacks so that you can actually progress in the game. 
                It doesn't really affect me though because I'm a sucker for grinding games like Clash of Clans and MapleStory so I found it enjoyable. But I can understand if people complain
                about that aspect of the game.
            </p>
            <p>
                I won't change the art style and mechanics of the game because I think it's pretty good as it is. The one thing I would change is to add strategies to completing levels. Choosing 
                to spawn your zombies at certain areas can help you complete a level that was previously impossible to complete sounds like a pretty fun option besides grinding till you stomp over everything.
                So essentially I would improve the level design of the game so that it can be played in several different ways rather than only one.

            <h2>Game 2: <a href="https://www.kongregate.com/games/MonkeyWantBanana/shopping-cart-hero?acomplete=shopping+cart+hero">Shopping Cart Hero</a></h2>
            <hr />
            <p>
                I chose Shopping Cart Hero because it is yet another childhood game of mine. I fondly remember playing it on Y8.com back in the day when websites were passed only through word of mouth.
                Playing it again after such a long hiatus has been refreshing and definitely nostalgic. Seeing how far we have come in game graphics and design is definitely inspiring in some ways.
            </p>
            <p>
                There isn't any background story to this game. You just slide down a ramp and perform tricks and stunts using arrow keys to earn points. Bonus points if you carry kids on your cart (Not recommended in real life).
                The more tricks you chain together, the higher the multiplier for the score is. The score translates directly into how much money you earn and you use that money to purchase upgrades and kids to fit in your cart
                (Again, not recommended irl). The upgrade prices get really ridiculous after you near the end-game so I usually stop playing before I finish buying everything.
            </p>
            <p>
                I take on the role of a stickman pushing a shopping cart down a slope. I try to land the gnarliest tricks and multipliers all while having kids on board. It is definitely a simple game sprung from a random idea,
                but it's still a well-made game nonetheless.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoyed it a lot. Especially when I manage to combo different stunts together getting big money. Having the freedom to perform any tricks is definitely the key component in this game. However, the end-game is 
                rather lackluster as I've said. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I would definitely create more upgrades to progress into the game, and harder to land tricks with big rewards to earn so the game wouldn't get stale after a short while of playing.
