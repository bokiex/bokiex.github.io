        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>
                I've always been a huge fan of games. The first game I've ever played was Super Mario 2, the uniqueness of each level, the secrets of each level, the feeling of accomplishment from beating Bowser.
                They are all fond memories of mine. It's hard to believe that a simple jump mechanic in a game can be pushed to such a limit. The fascination I held for good games still holds even today.
                However, it's not just video games that I'm into. Sports also played a big part in my life together with card games and board games such as Hearthstone and Monopoly.
                I've spent most of my childhood playing games from all platforms. From the GameBoy Advanced to PS4, ping pong ball to basketball. I won't be surprised if I spent over 10,000 hours on games alone in my life.
            </strong>

            <strong>
                The reason why games run, if at all, is because of the programming behind it. The amount of calculation, coding and creativity needed to program a game from scratch is something that always left me astounded.
                Especially if it's a good game. I realised that all the beautiful video games I've played is the product of someone's idea coming to life. That is why I wanted to learn how to program a game of my own.
